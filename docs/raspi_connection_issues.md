#### Your Raspberry Pi's IP Address May Not Be Visible or There May Be a Connection Issue  
- Follow the steps below to verify the connection and try again:  

1. **Restarting the Raspberry Pi**  
   - Restart your Raspberry Pi and ensure it is connected to your Mac via an Ethernet cable.  

2. **Checking the IP Address Again**  
   - Run the following command in the terminal again to check connected devices:
     
```bash
arp -a
```
3. **Connecting Using mDNS**  
   - Your Raspberry Pi may also be accessible via **station1.local**. Try the following command:  

```bash
ssh pi@station1.local
```
4. **Finding the IP Address Manually**  
   - If you still cannot find the IP address, run the following command on your Raspberry Pi to retrieve it:  
    

```bash
hostname -I
```
- This command will display the IP address of your Raspberry Pi on the connected network. 
5. **Connecting via IP Address**  
   - Once you have retrieved the IP address, use the following command in the Mac Terminal to connect via SSH:  

```bash
ssh pi@[bulduÄŸunuz_ip_adresi]
```
- If these steps do not resolve the issue, there might be another connection problem. In that case, check the cable connection and network settings again or try a different method, such as connecting via Wi-Fi.
